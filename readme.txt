java software tool
used as visualiser to the gps nmea target
work with embedded hardware that used GPS and GSM to track a car
tool is like google map but build 2003 before google map.
can be ported to web via java-applet

it was my End & Midterm training project :
Geo localization package using GPS, the embedded system is based on 8051 micro-controller and GSM communication,
GPS position is saved on EEPROM and it's sent using SMS or DATA (GSM) to the database
it's displayed via web-based  Java-Applet or Java localisation tool.
The project is the main product of Alphatec, it went into sale in 2004
and is maintained and upgraded till now, (in 2009 : 25.000 vehicle flowed by GPRS).
